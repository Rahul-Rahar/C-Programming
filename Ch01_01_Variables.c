        // VAERIABLES :- Variables are names given to a Memory Location
        // Variables Decared and initialized by writing type variable_name = value;
int main() {
    int a = 5; // Here 'a' is variable in which '5' is Value assigned to it. Thus 'a' is a memory location where '5' is reserved.
    char _rahul = 'B'; // Here _rahul is also a Variable where 'B' assigned to it.
    

    // Some rules for naming a variable:
    // 1. Variable name can contain Alphabets, Underscore(_), Digits
    // 2. Can Start only with Alphabets or Underscore(_) only and can't start with a Digit, Special Characters.

    // 3. No whitespace and reserved keywords are allowed. Like (rahul rahar) here between space not allowed.

    // 4. Variable name should be unique.
    
    // 5. Variable name should not be too long.
    
    // 6. Variable name should be meaningful.
    
    // 7. Variable name should be easy to understand.

    // Valid Variables Name:
    int hello;
    float erics123;
    char _nice34;

    // Invalid Variables :
    /* int 123hello; // Here '123' is a Digit and can't be at
       
       int hello world; // Here ' ' is a whitespace and can't be in variable name
